<h1>Full-history feed reader</h1>

<p>
This is a prototype feed reader that is designed for reading webcomics,
serial stories, and other serialized creative works. To use it, you need
the URL of the RSS or Atom feed that corresponds to the series you want
to read.
</p>

<p>
This implementation only supports WordPress feeds and RFC5005-conforming
feeds; you'll get an error for anything else. It also does not do feed
auto-discovery, so most likely the URL you need here either has the word
"feed" in it or ends with <code>.rss</code> or <code>.xml</code>.
</p>
